tandem
======

Tandem is a content management system for synchronous oral tasks for language learners.This tool will administer complementary contents to students working on a task together in a synchronous medium. The tool will retrieve the user information from the environment (e.g. Moodle classroom, Mahara group) and connect a pair or a group of students to carry out a language learning task. It will assign each student a role (i.e. student A, student B) and hand out to each student different contents belonging to same task in order to prompt authentic goal-oriented communication characteristic of fill-in-the-gap tasks.
